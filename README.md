# The Roguelike Tutorial In Rust

This is an implementation of the Rust Roguelike tutorial from [this](https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/) tutorial provided by Tomas Sedovic.

It has a few idiosyncracies and things implemented differently as I personally use this as a launching point to learn more about the Rust language and what it has to offer.

This project is undertaken as part of the 2019 [r/roguelikedev does the Roguelike Tutorial 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/br1sv3/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/) as a learning process for myself.

I have previously done the Roguelike tutorial in Python: see my [bltilerogue](https://github.com/graysentinel/bltilerogue) repository for an incomplete Python implementation using bearlibterminal for visual output.
